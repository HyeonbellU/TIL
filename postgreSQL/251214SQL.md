251214 postgreSQL
===================
This learning starts at 251214 right after I finish MySQL lecture in FastCampus.
Although I learned MySQL at first, what I learned is so fraction of SQL, so it won't be matter whether I change lang or not.

# start
- open my lenovo laptop, which runs by Ubuntu.

# progress
- create account : not to use superuser all the time
 + CREATE USER [username] WITH PASSWORD [password];
 + ALTER USER [username] \[CREATEDB];

- see list of roles
 + \du

- create database
 + CREATE DATABASE [database_name] OWNER [creater username]
 + psql -U [creater username] -d [database name]

# next step
- create conf file : pg_hba.conf
